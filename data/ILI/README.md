# A time series of influenza-like illness incidence in the Netherlands

flu-sampler requires a timeseries of influenza-like illness (ILI) data as input.
We developed the model for a Dutch dataset published in the DANS repository:

>  Hooiveld, PhD M. (NIVEL) (2017): A time series of influenza-like illness incidence in the Netherlands. DANS. [https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-zv3-54c6](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-zv3-54c6)

The *codebook* (`codebook.pdf`) is also added to the current folder. To repeat our analysis, one must download the file `ILI_NL_1970_2014.csv`. This requires permission from [NIVEL](https://www.nivel.nl/en)
